# `kwandl`: Keyword arguments handled
## Installation

Install `kwandl` using `pip`:

```console
python3 -m pip install kwandl
```

To install the most recent development version directly from the GitHub repository run:

```console
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/egpbos/kwandl.git
```

## Usage

`kwandl` is essentially a box of magic tricks to make working with `kwargs` smoother.

### Forward passing only relevant `kwargs`
Say you have a function `top` which takes `**kwargs` and passes them on to `ding` and `boop`:
```python
def top(**kwargs):
    ding(**kwargs)
    boop(**kwargs)
```
Only problem is: `ding` and `boop` have different sets of keyword arguments:
```python
def ding(dingo=1, dinga=2):
    ...

def boop(boopie=3, boonk=4):
    ...
```
This means `top(dingo="blurg", boonk=None)` will fail with a `TypeError`, because `boonk` will be passed to `ding` and `dingo` will be passed to `boop`, both of which are invalid.

`kwandl` solves this for you with one simple decorator:
```python
@kwandl.forward
def top(**kwargs):
    ding(**kwargs)
    boop(**kwargs)
```
This _Just Worksâ„¢_.

It does so by modifying the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the function calls with `kwargs` as argument so that `kwargs` is effectively replaced by `kwandl.get_kwargs_applicable_to_function(ding, kwargs)` (or `boop` instead of `ding` depending on the calling function).
An alternative way to use this `kwandl` functionality then is to use `get_kwargs_applicable_to_function` directly:

```python
def top(**kwargs):
    ding(**kwandl.get_kwargs_applicable_to_function(ding, kwargs))
    boop(**kwandl.get_kwargs_applicable_to_function(boop, kwargs))
```

Note, however, that `@kwandl.forward` does a bit more: it also checks whether kwargs contains keyword arguments that are a match to neither `ding` nor `boop` and raises a `TypeError` if so.
A complete alternative notation for `@kwandl.forward` would then be:

```python
def top(**kwargs):
    ding_kwargs = kwandl.get_kwargs_applicable_to_function(ding, kwargs)
    boop_kwargs = kwandl.get_kwargs_applicable_to_function(boop, kwargs)

    unexpected_keywords = set(kwargs) - set(ding_kwargs) - set(boop_kwargs)

    if unexpected_keywords:
        raise TypeError(f"top() got an unexpected keyword argument '{unexpected_keywords.pop()}'")

    ding(**ding_kwargs)
    boop(**boop_kwargs)
```
The motivation behind this package should now become clearer: the amount of boilerplate necessary to solve what in my mind should not be such a huge problem is ... well, huge.
